# TriviaGame

## Overview

This project is a Trivia Game.  Open the [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/TriviaGame).  Click on the "Start" button to begin the game. You have 45 seconds.  Answer as many questions as you can.  Then select "Check Answers."  Hint: the theme of this game is Patriotic. 

### Problem 
In this game, the user gets a a number of trivia questions that the user has to answer.  The game is further enhanced because the user only has 45 seconds to answer all of the trivia questions.  After submitting the answers to the trivia questions, the user is presented with stats about how many answers the user got correct and how many answers the user got incorrect.  

### How I solved it
This game uses only frontend technology.  

### Technical Approach
I solved this problem by using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. I used HTML form methods to create the questions. and CSS to style the page.  I used Javascript's timeout function to end the game after 45 seconds.  Then, I used jQuery to edit and update the DOM to update the player with the number of correct and incorrect answers.
